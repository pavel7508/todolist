        This application is used to record tasks with deadlines , red marked deadlines indicate unfulfilled tasks in the deadline , yellow indicate that they need to be completed within three days. This application is my first attempt at programming, so please rate it in the Contact section so that I can continue to develop. Thank you Pavel ZÃ½ma
